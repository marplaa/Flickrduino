Sure, here's a possible readme.md file for the BlinkSync project:

# BlinkSync

BlinkSync is a simple method for transmitting binary data between two microcontrollers using just two phototransistors and a display. By flickering the display at a specific frequency and encoding the data as changes in the color of individual pixels, BlinkSync allows for reliable wireless communication without the need for complex radio modules or protocols.

## How it works

BlinkSync uses a custom protocol to encode binary data as changes in the color of individual pixels on a display. Specifically, the display is divided into two halves, with each half representing a binary state (e.g., 0 or 1). A phototransistor with a red filter is pointed at one half, while a phototransistor with a green filter is pointed at the other half. By flickering the display at a specific frequency and changing the color of individual pixels, the sender can transmit binary data that the receiver can decode by comparing the signals from the two phototransistors.

## Use cases

BlinkSync is ideal for low-bandwidth wireless communication between microcontrollers, especially in situations where a wired connection is not feasible or desirable. Some possible use cases include:

- Transmitting WiFi credentials to an ESP8266 or similar device
- Sending configuration settings to an Arduino or other microcontroller
- Controlling a remote device with simple commands (e.g., turning a motor on or off)

## Getting started

To use BlinkSync, you will need:

- Two phototransistors with red and green filters, respectively
- A display that can be controlled by a microcontroller
- An Arduino or other microcontroller to send and receive data

Once you have these components, you can start experimenting with BlinkSync by following the instructions in the [examples](examples/) folder.
